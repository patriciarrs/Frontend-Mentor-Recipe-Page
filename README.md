## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS media queries

### What I learned

#### HTML5 semantic elements: `article` vs `section`

- `article`

Self-contained composition intended to be independently distributable or reusable.

Examples: forum post, magazine or newspaper article, blog entry, product card, user-submitted comment, interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content.

Each `article` should including a heading.

- `section`

Generic standalone section of a document, which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it.

As an example,a list of search results or a map display and its controls don't have specific elements, and could be put inside a `section`.

Alternatives:

- Navigation menu - `nav`.
- Atomic unit of content that makes sense as a standalone piece - `article`.
- Useful tangential information that works alongside the main content, but is not directly part of it (like related links, or an author bio) - `aside`.
- Main content area of a document - `main`.
- Only using the element as a styling wrapper - `div`.

Sections should always have a heading, with very few exceptions, for example, a secondary navigation mechanism or some kind of button bar for controlling your app.

### Useful resources

- [<article>: The Article Contents element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article) - This helped me remember the details of usage for the `article` HTML element.
- [<section>: The Generic Section element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section) - This helped me remember the details of usage for the `section` HTML element.
